New VS addin
============

Rewritten from scratch. Only runs on VS2012 for now.

Configuration
=============

Create a file called 'config.ss' in the VS extensions directory (not the one plugin where the plugin is installed).

Add the following to point to your IronScheme or any library location:

(library-path 
  (append (library-path) 
          (list "your location")))

This will run when either the REPL or classifier is run for the first time.


Tips
====

To improve IronScheme startup speed, I recommend NGEN'ing.

You can do this with the following command:

ngen install IronScheme.VisualStudio.dll
