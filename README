New VS addin
============

Rewritten from scratch. Only runs on VS2012 for now.

Configuration
=============

Create a file called 'config.ss' in the VS extensions directory (not the one plugin where the plugin is installed).

Add the following to point to your IronScheme or any library location:

(library-path 
  (append (library-path) 
          (list "your location")))

This will run when either the REPL or classifier is run for the first time.

Todo list
=========

[*] Classifier
[*] ErrorTagger
[*] SmartIndent
[*] Interactive window
[ ] Outliner
[ ] Snippets
[ ] Project support
[ ] Editor options
[ ] SignatureHelper
[ ] DropDowns
[ ] IEditorOperationsFactoryService
[ ] Strip trailing whitespace on save

Extra 'tooltips'
================

[ ] Show import location (perhaps 'goto definition')
[ ] Procedure info for those defined in the source code (currently only hightlighted)
[ ] Info for locals (perhaps arrows like DrRacket does?)
